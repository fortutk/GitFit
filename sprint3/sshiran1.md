Issue [#43](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/GitFit/issues/43) - Create routes so that each page can be accessed separately

### What you did not do
There are some minor mistakes and imporvements that can be made in some of the tools, so I plan on working on those next sprint and making sure that everything is perfect for the presentation

### What problems you encountered
During this sprint, I worked a bit on making the tools pages more astetically pleasing. I'm going to have to keep working on this next sprint a bit because the coloring of the text needs to be changed to a color which is easier to see. Likwise, I need to touch up some of the tools during the next sprint.

### What you accomplished
During this sprint, the first thing I was able to accomplish was creating a protein calculator on the file protein.js. This calculates the amount of protein a person should be consuming based on their weight. I was also able to create a route for the home page and link it to each separate home page. So for example, each tool is now on a separate page and can be accessed directly from the home page. Lastly, I was able to make the pages more aesthetically pleasing and link them to Jack's home page.
