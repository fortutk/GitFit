### What you planned to do

Issue [#44](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/GitFit/issues/44) - I planned to add specific workouts meaning adding sets and reps for all the different kind of workouts that will be done based on user input

Issue [#45](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/GitFit/issues/45) - I planned to add a heart rate feature to the workouts based on what was got from Shervin's heart rate calculator.

Issue [#46](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/GitFit/issues/46) - I planned to add error checking for the input so that it would only accept the input that was specified in the example

### What you did not do

I was not able to link with everyone that I would have liked on this sprint meaning on the next sprint we will need to link all together in order to get the workouts to log after they are made.

### What problems you encountered

The cardio tool was not as easy as I thought to switch over so I wasn't able to get that to just pop up with the rest of my inputs because it would be a little redundent whenever you have the heart rate calculator from Shervin.

### Issues you worked on

Issue [#44] - Based on the workout preferences, add in different sets and reps for things

Issue [#45] - Added in a heart rate feature so they can use Shervin's heart rate calculator and add that into their workout

Issue [#46] - Add error checking for input

### Files you worked on
- Jblackab/src/app.js
- Jblackab/src/Form.js

### What you accomplished
I was able to go back through all the different types of outputs and make distinct outputs based on what the input is. I also went ahead and added in the heart rate and added that in for the heart rate that was needed for certain workouts. I also then added in the error checking for the inputs to clean up the code so that it wouldnt just output nothing, or put accidently put something that wasn't in the desired input, instead it will print out an error message if the input does not match and will print the workouts if everthing clears correctly.
