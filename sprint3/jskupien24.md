### What you did not do
The only thing I planned to do, but couldn't figure out was to change the page cards to be more visible. I tried very hard to manipulate everything, but could not find a visible color scheme that also matches that of the website.

### What problems you encountered
* Working with other people's code was very difficult for me because I am super particular with my formatting, so I started by reformatting everything.

* Both Fort and Shervin's pages included UI material from an installed package, which I was not at all familiar with the workings of. 

* My computer ruined itself over the course of the last week and I had to have a full factory reset, which really set me behind schedule because I had to spend hours downloading the stuff I need again.

### What you accomplished
I got everything I wanted to get done this week and more. I had a lot of trouble creating a dropdown menu in the navbar for the tools tab, but eventually figured it out. I linked all of Shervin's tools to that dropdown menu, and for the most part overhauled them with formatting and function. They are now connected and match the rest of the website. THe formatting included things like rounding off decimal places, changing fonts/color schemes, creating a picture background, and changing the wording of things for aesthetic reasons. For the login/signup/forgot password (LSF) pages, I did the same sort of formatting overhaul. Finally, I made the navbar stay at the top no matter what because in recent development stages, you would route to a page and then it would disappear, making it impossible to return to the home screen or go to another page.
