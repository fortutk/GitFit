### What you did not do
I started working on creating background images on my tools page in order to make the user experience better, but it needs to be improved. I tried using different methods, but will continue working on it during the next sprint. 
### What problems you encountered
I ran into some issues with implementing a background photo into my tools page. I started working on and researching ways in which you can implement photos in react and have attempted various ways of implementing it and will continue working on it in the next sprint.
