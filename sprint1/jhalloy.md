### What you planned to do

Issue [#7](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/GitFit/issues/7) - I planned to create a workout class/struct for storing each workouts data. The high level nature of react meant that I did not really need to create type definitions and explicitly define all elements. I can simply add elements to a list enclosed in brackets { }.

Issue [#8](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/GitFit/issues/8) - I planned to create a workout tracking webpage with a heading and some interface of the workouts done. Also, a means to add workouts to your list.

Issue [#9](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/GitFit/issues/9) - I planned to implement functionality between where I store my workout data and the workout tracking webpage.

### What you did not do
I started creating some functionality between the workout tracking page and workout data, but it can only print out the data so far. Also, the workout data is currently manually written in the code.

### What problems you encountered
I had some general problems of getting react to work since I had not used it before. I made some simple mistakes such as putting the incorrect name in the export line, which caused confusing results.

### What you accomplished
I created a simple webpage that has a header and a button. Currently the button only sends a log to the console "create new workout" when clicked, but later this function can be changed to add a new workout. The page also prints out the list of workouts with the data contained inside. This is formatted with some css code to have a light blue background and show up as boxes. Later this can be made to look better.
