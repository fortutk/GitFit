# Sprint 2

github: jskupien24

group Name: GitFit

### What you planned to do

Issue [#25](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/GitFit/issues/25) - Further build out the home page and try to animate the logo

Issue [#26](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/GitFit/issues/26) - figure out what tabs we actually need

Issue [#27](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/GitFit/issues/27) - try to link the login tabs to Fort's pages

### What you did not do

I figured a lot out, but some stuff broke in the process and I didn't get a chance to fix it. When I added in the necessary tabs, I was able to fix the navbar, but the hover function for the drop down hamburger menu for mobile got kind of messed up.

### What problems you encountered
I had a ridiculously hard time getting the logo to animate. It looks good, but it took probably a total of 4 hours to get it to look right. When I finally did, I had to fix the scrolling so it would stick to the navbar, rather tham scrolling with the rest of the content. I also had so much trouble linking Fort's pages to mine, but finally got the routes figured out.

### What you accomplished
First, I did a lot of fixing for things that have been bugging me, including scrolling, hamburger menu, and button sizes. I also worked on making the Home page more professional. I imported better fonts, messed around with the font colors, and changed around the buttons. I also animated the buttons, the logo, the drop down menu, and the hover functions. I also changed the tabs to organize our website and be able to incorporate the the tools my team members made. Finally, I pulled the pages that Fort has been working on, and changed the routes of my App.css file to be able to link to Fort's pages.
