### What you accomplished
During this sprint, the first thing I was able to accomplish was creating a water calculator on the file water.js. This calculates the amount of water a person should be consuming based on their weight. I was also able to format it correctly and add it onto the home page on the tools tab. Then, when the user selects the water tab, the water calculator will appear. Likewise, during this sprint, I worked on making sure all of the other tools worked correctly. Also, I worked on the powerpoint presentation for when we will present for our final sprint.
