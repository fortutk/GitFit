# Sprint 2

Fort Hunter

github: fortutk

group Name: GitFit

### What you planned to do

Issue [#16](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/GitFit/issues/16) - Link login, sign up, and forget password pages

Issue [#17](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/GitFit/issues/17) - Start working on the backend to store user data

Issue [#28](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/GitFit/issues/28) - Implement username and password complexity requirements

### What you did not do
I was not able to finish implementing the backend.  For this app we are going to be using firebase as our data storage method.  I have our page set up and just need to finish adding users once they sign up.
### What problems you encountered
The biggest problem I ran into was trying to link my pages together.  I was trying to follow along to a guide that was for a past version of react and did not realize and was confused as to why it was not working.  It took me an embarassing amount of time to realize what the issue was and once I realized I was able to fix my problem.  I also had some issues figuring out firebase but I feel like I hace a decent understanding of it now and will be able to implement it further in the next sprint.

### What you accomplished
During sprint 2 I was able to link all of my pages together.  They have links to eachother on the pages and when you click on them it redirects to the new page.  I also implemented client side verification for signing up for a new account.  Basically what this does is check all the fields and makes sure they have the correct stuff.  I checked that they had typed a first and last name, that their username was at least 3 characters, their email contained the '@' symbol, and their password was at least 8 characters.  Lastly, I was able to start working on some of the backend.  I did not get as much done as I woulf have liked but hopefully I will be able to get more done in the coming sprint.
