## What You Accomplished

In This sprint I was able to go in and merge with Jack for our final project, I also went through and added into the workouts weight to do based on your One Rep Max. Merging cause a problem but we got it figured out and cleaned up ready for our presentation. I have also been working on the powerpoint presentation for the class. Most of my work during this sprint was error checking especially after we merged.
