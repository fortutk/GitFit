### What I Planned to do

Issue [#24](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/GitFit/issues/24) - I wanted to take the workouts that I had made and get them to print to the website

Issue [#29](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/GitFit/issues/29) - I wanted to create classes for workouts depending different gym goals, body types, and days

Issue [#30](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/GitFit/issues/30) - I wanted to take the user input and based off of what they entered, alter the workout to match their wantes meaning it prints workouts depending on days, goals, body. 

### What You Did Not Do

I was able to get all the things to workouts to print out to the screen, but I was not able to read the heart rate and determine what the heart rate should be while running since that part was with Julian and Shervin and we decided not to merge with this sprint so we could work seperatly

### What Problems I Encountered

Getting the inputs to save so that I could case compare them was much harder than I thought, I also couldn't figure out how to get the if statements to work. I also didn't have the heart rate or the ability to save the workouts yet because we haven't mereged but once we do we will be able to track everyones progress through the programs.

### Issues You Workout On

Issue [#24](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/GitFit/issues/24) - Try To Print the Workouts to website page

Issue [#29](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/GitFit/issues/29) - Create Classes for the workouts

Issue [#30](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/GitFit/issues/30) - Depending on user input seperate workouts so they are specific to body type and heart rate

### Files You Worked On

- jblackab/src/App.js
- jblackab/src/Form.js

### What You Accomplished

I made it to where the App now reads in the input, stores it, and then gives back the user workouts for every week depending on what the user entered for their goals, body goals, and days they want to workout for a week. It then prints out the workout to the page, and if cardio is involoved (depends on goal) will recommend a heart rate to start at.
