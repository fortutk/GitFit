## What You did Not Do
I was unable to get the information inputed for each person stored yet, but that will be the next part with linking
## What Problems you Encountered
Learning React took me a lot longer than I expected, it is much different than any other syntax I have used before, so learning the ropes took up a lot of time
## Issues You Worked On

#13 - Learning React

#14 - Creating workouts based on certain inputs and goals

#15 - On website taking in what the workout goal is

## What you Accomplished
For this sprint, I was able to design workouts for different days that will be able to fit right into the code with restraints added in on days willing to workout, body desired, Goal. But the main plan is designed. Next I was able to learn react (took a lottttt longer than expeced) and I still wouldnt say I've learned it inside and out, but I know enough. After learning react, I was able to make the page that will read in the users desired body, goal, and days they are wanting to workout a week. I also added the examples to show what the options are.
