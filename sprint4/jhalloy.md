### What you accomplished
During sprint 4, I added functionality which saves and loads the user's workouts from local storage. This lets the workouts persist in the workout tracker when the user refreshes or leaves the page. An important part of this was also to update the workouts when they are deleted and not just when a new workout is added. I also updated the README to have better documentation and instructions on how to run the web application.
