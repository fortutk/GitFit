Group Name: GitFit

### What you planned to do

Issue [#4](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/GitFit/issues/4) - I planned to learn React and learn how its syntax works.

Issue [#5](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/GitFit/issues/5) - I planned to add a calorie calculation tool given weight, height, age, gender

Issue [#6](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/GitFit/issues/6) - I planned to create a BMI calculation tool

### What you did not do
I was unable to get the BMI and Calorie tools on separate pages. Also, I want to "beautify" both of these pages.

### What problems you encountered
With learning react, it was diffcult learning how the syntax works as it is very different from what I am used to with C and C++.

### Issues you worked on
[#4](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/GitFit/issues/4) Learning React

[#5](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/GitFit/issues/5) Adding calorie calculation given weight, height, age, gender

[#6](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/GitFit/issues/6) Creating a BMI calculation tool

### Files you worked on
 - Shervin/src/App.js
 - Shervin/src/bmi.js
 - Shervin/src/calorie.js

### What you accomplished
First, I was able to create a BMI calculation tool. This read in user input which includes weight and height. Then, using those inputs, it would calculate the users Body Mass Index and also provide a table which shows the user what that number correlates to. I was also able to create a calorie calculation tool. This tool would read in user input which includes weight, height, age. Then, it would calculate the number of calories the user burns during a typical day based on their gender and activity level.
